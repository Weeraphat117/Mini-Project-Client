      <p>
        A library is a curated collection of sources of information and similar resources, selected 
        by experts and made accessible to a defined community for reference or borrowing, often in 
        a quiet environment conducive to study. It provides physical or digital access to material,
        and may be a physical location or a virtual space, or both. A library's collection can include 
        books, periodicals, newspapers, manuscripts, films, maps, prints, documents, microform, CDs, 
        cassettes, videotapes, DVDs, Blu-ray Discs, e-books, audiobooks, databases, and other formats.
